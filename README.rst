Personal Scripts
================

This repository contains a collection of assorted scripts I have written or copied from somewhere
else over the years.

These are mostly small utilities for specific tasks, which probably are of little use to anybody
else but me and my specific Linux environment. But there are some generally useful scripts, for
example for generating M3U playlists, managing Python virtual environments, pretty printing some
file types, sending email from the comand line and so on.

Check each script for a small description of what it does at the beginning of the file.

I have tried to reference the source of the script, in case it was not written by me, but in some
cases I have forgotten where it came from. If you are the author of anything included here and
desire proper attribution, please contact me.
