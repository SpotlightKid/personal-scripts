accountdb
=========

Manages an encrypted database holding arbitrary key/value pairs.

Useful for storing account information such as usernames, password, email etc.


.. warning::
    **DO NOT USE**

    This is a very old script, which I wrote when I was still a Python novice and computing
    was a much safer place then it is now.

    The encryption it uses is probably very easy to beark and it lacks proper error checking
    so that the possibility for data loss is **VERY HIGH**.

    I keep it around in case I still need access to an old password file in a backaup created
    with it.

    Nowadays, I use pass_.
