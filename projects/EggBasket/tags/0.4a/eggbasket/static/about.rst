EggBasket is simple, lightweight Python Package Index (aka Cheeseshop) clone.

.. contents::
    :depth: 1


Overview
--------

EggBasket_ is a web application which provides a service similar and compatible
to the `Python Package Index`_ (aka Cheeseshop). It allows you to maintain your own local repository of Python packages required by your installations.

It is implemented using the TurboGears_ web framework, Genshi_ and SQLAlchemy_.

.. warning::
    This is still alpha-stage software. All the basic operations necessary
    to support a setuptools-based infrastructure are there, but some
    convenience features are missing and the software has not been tested
    extensively. **Use at your own risk!**


Features
--------

* Can be used by setuptools/easy_install as the package index and repository.

* Supports the distutils ``upload`` protocol.

* Has a simple role-based permission system to restrict package uploads (but see
  TODO).

* Requires only SQLite as the database system (included with Python 2.5).

* Is able to read and display meta data from the following distribution package
  formats (source and binary):

  ``.egg``, ``.tar``, ``.tar.bz2``, ``.tar.gz``, ``.tgz``, ``.zip``

* Any other file format can be configured to be listed under the distribution
  files for a package (by default this includes ``.exe`` and ``.rpm`` and
  ``.tar.Z`` files in addition to the filetypes listed above).

* Can be run without any configuration by just starting it from within a
  directory containing package directories (see "Usage").


Todo
----

* Improve permission system to allow closed-shop repositories on an open
  network or uploading for anonymous users.
* Add support for MD5 check sums and GPG signatures.
* Add more error and sanity checks to the upload handling.
* Add pagination to the main package list.
* Support deletion of packages through web interface.
* Cache package listings and meta data.
* Improve DBmechanic-based admin interface for adding users and groups and
  setting configuration values (currently disabled by default).

This application is a re-implementation (almost no shared code) of the
haufe.eggserver_ Grok application with some improvements.
