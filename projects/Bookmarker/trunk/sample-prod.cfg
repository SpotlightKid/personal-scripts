# This is where all of your settings go for your production environment.
# You'll copy this file over to your production server and provide it
# as a command-line option to your start script.
# Settings that are the same for both development and production
# (such as template engine, encodings, etc.) all go in
# bookmarker/config/app.cfg

# pick the form for your database
# sqlobject.dburi="postgres://username@hostname/databasename"
# sqlobject.dburi="mysql://username:password@hostname:port/databasename"
# sqlobject.dburi="sqlite:///file_name_and_path"

# If you have sqlite, here's a simple default to get you started
# in development
sqlobject.dburi="sqlite://%(current_dir_uri)s/dadat/proddata.sqlite"


# if you are using a database or table type without transactions
# (MySQL default, for example), you should turn off transactions
# by prepending notrans_ on the uri
# sqlobject.dburi="notrans_mysql://username:password@hostname:port/databasename"

# for Windows users, sqlite URIs look like:
# sqlobject.dburi="sqlite:///drive_letter:/path/to/file"


# SERVER

server.environment="production"

# Sets the number of threads the server uses
# server.thread_pool = 1

# if this is part of a larger site, you can set the path
# to the TurboGears instance here
# server.webpath=""

# session_filter.on = True

# Set to True if you'd like to abort execution if a controller gets an
# unexpected parameter. False by default
# tg.strict_parameters = False

# LOGGING
# Logging configuration generally follows the style of the standard
# Python logging module configuration. Note that when specifying
# log format messages, you need to use *() for formatting variables.
# Deployment independent log configuration is in bookmarker/config/log.cfg
