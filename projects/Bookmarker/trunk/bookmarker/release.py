"""A very simple bookmark directory.

This is a TurboGears_ sample application. It is a simple bookmark directory, that allows you to collect bookmarks with a title, a URL, and a description and assign arbitrary tags to each bookmark.

It was developed as an example to accompany a short introductory talk to the
`development of web applications with TurboGears`_ (in German language).
I have since then also used it as an example for `another talk on TurboGears`_,
for the `RuPy conference 2007`_, in Poszna≈Ñ.

This is intended as a demonstration, it is not a full application, so please don't complain about missing features :-)
