- If you click on an empty search term field and select a value from the
  browser's completion list, the search buttons don't get enabled (is there a
  non-standard JavaScript event for auto-completion?).

- CSS tooltips for form fields do not work in IE (does not support :hover
  pseudo CSS class on elements other than links).

- Comment preview only works with JavaScript enabled (uses AJAJ).

- Dito for article preview.

- No fixes for various IE display bugs:
    - double horizontal margins on some elements
    - wrong element width because of improper padding due to wrong
      CSS box model of IE <= 5.5)
    - difference in interpretation of CSS font-sizes

- the textile parser module doesn't handle <pre> blocks correctly, it
  insert <p> tags, where it shouldn't, thereby screwing up pre-formatted
  source code in comments.

- Firefox <= 1.5 does not show the text cursor in the comment form, when it
  is un-hidden by clicking on the "Add a comment" link. If the form is
  already visible on page load, the cursor is there. Firefox 2.0 seems to
  work fine.
